<p>My name is Marc-Anthony Bauer and I'm a Research Engineer and Computational Linguist. </p>
<p>My professional interests lie in the intersection of human language and computational systems. 
I am especially interested in using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from existing, unstructured data. I like building large-scale projects, going from customer-oriented design to deployment in a production environment.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by cutting-edge technologies and believe in their potential to shape the world for the better.</p>
<p>
In my free time, I like to read, travel and make music in Ableton Live.
