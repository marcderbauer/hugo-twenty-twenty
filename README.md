# Hugo 2020
This is the repository for my personal [website](https://marcanthonybauer.com).

## About
This repository is the main/"backend" repo for my website. It uses Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages.  
The GitHub pages repo can be found [here](https://github.com/marcderbauer/marcderbauer.github.io)  

## Setup
I personally wouldn't recommend copying this repo. You would likely be better off copying the [original repository](https://github.com/themefisher/twenty-twenty-hugo).
If you, for whatever reason still want to copy this repository, you can do so like this:
  
### 1. Install Hugo
If you want to run this repo you will need to [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) Hugo first. 
  
### 2. Clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/marcderbauer/hugo-twenty-twenty.git

### 3. Run locally  
    cd hugo-twenty-twenty  
    hugo server
 
 This will start a local server, which you can (most likely) access at [<code>localhost:1313</code>](http://localhost:1313/)
