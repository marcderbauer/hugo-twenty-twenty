# Hugo 2020
This is the repository for my personal [website](https://marcanthonybauer.com).

## :dizzy: About  
This repository is the main/"backend" repo for my website. It uses Hugo and is hosted on GitHub Pages.  
The GitHub pages repo can be found [here](https://github.com/marcderbauer/marcderbauer.github.io)    

## :question: Why Hugo
Hugo is a fairly staightforward static site generator. I always thought I didn't want a static website, as dynamic content would be great for blogs. However, you can create beautiful blogs in Hugo, despite them being static.  
The real advantage in static websites lies in their simplicity. The website being static allows it to be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), where you can host one personal website for free.
I recommend anyone building a personal website to give Hugo a shot. You likely won't need dynamic content and the simplicity and lack of hosting costs are a blessing.

## :computer: Setup
I personally wouldn't recommend copying this repo. You would likely be better off copying the [original repository](https://github.com/themefisher/twenty-twenty-hugo).
If you, for whatever reason still want to copy this repository, you can do so like this:
  
### 1. Install Hugo
If you want to run this repo you will need to [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) Hugo first. 
  
### 2. Clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/marcderbauer/hugo-twenty-twenty.git

### 3. Run locally  
    cd hugo-twenty-twenty  
    hugo server
 
 This will start a local server, which you can (most likely) access at [<code>localhost:1313</code>](http://localhost:1313/)
